# IOT-BASED-SOUND-POLLUTION-MONITORING-SYSTEM-USING-NODE-MCU
Do these step by step process for excecuting the project 
1) copy and paste the preference link in the preference section available in the files tab,i am providing the link bellow 
----->>https://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json<<----
2) install NodeMcu libraries in the arduino IDE
3) install i2c library for using lcd module
4) also install "CH341SER" driver for using NodeMcu
5) connect the circuit as per the given image , next step is set up of thingspeak
6) sign up with your mail id in the thingpeak
7) now create new channel in the thingspeak fill out all the deatils required
8) after completing the setup copy your write api and paste it in the code
9) also make sure that you are using 2.4Ghz wifi band
10) most important is your NodeMcu and your laptop/desktop has to be on same 2.4Ghz wifi band 
11) i have aslo attached the outputs from the thingspeak in the repository
